Using this project:
==================

- Install docker and docker-compose
- Then run:
   
  docker-compose up --build


What will that ^ do?
===================

--> Launch two instances of Neo4J
  
    + one for development and one for testing

--> Launch the flask builtin server
  
    + which will serve the endpoints, templates, etc.
    + for production, i.e. setup a gunicorn worker and deploy on heroku


Project Structure:
=================

--> models.py:
    ---------
    definition of nodes and relationships
    that comprise the model

--> factory.py: 
    ----------
    the flask app factory pattern

--> extensions.py:
    ------------- 
    all flask extensions used get initialized here

--> views.py:
    --------
    the endpoints for the API/server

--> _cliapp.py:
    ---------- 
    the entrypoint to the flask app instance 
    for this project


Running the tests:
=================

  docker-compose exec web pytest


Other hints:
===========

  Try these in a new terminal:
  (After running docker-compose up --build)

    - docker-compose exec web sh
    - docker-compose exec web python 

  - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml is 
    where the magic happens
